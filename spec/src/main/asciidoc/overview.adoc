= Service Health checks

== Motivation

Health checks are used to probe the state of a computing node from another other machine (i.e. kubernetes service controller) with the primary target being cloud infrastructure environments where automated processes maintain the state of computing nodes.

In this scenario _health checks are used to determine if a computing node needs to be discarded (terminated, shutdown)_ and eventually replaced by another (healthy) instance.

Itâ€™s not intended (although could be used) as a monitoring solution for human operators.

== Proposed solution

The proposed solution breaks down into two parts:

- A Java API to implement health check procedures
- A health checks protocol and wireformat
