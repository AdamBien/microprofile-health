# Service Healthchecks

## Motivation

Health checks are used to probe the state of a computing node from another other machine (i.e. kubernetes service controller) with the primary target being cloud infrastructure environments where automated processes maintain the state of computing nodes.

In this scenario _health checks are used to determine if a computing node needs to be discarded (terminated, shutdown)_ and eventually replaced by another (healthy) instance.

It’s not intended (although could be used) as a monitoring solution for human operators.

## Proposed solution

The proposed solution breaks down into two parts:

- A health checks protocol and wireformat
- A Java API to implement health check procedures

## Detailed design

### Protocol

This project defines a protocol (wireformat, semantics and possible forms of interactions) between system components that need to determine the “liveliness” of computing nodes in a bigger architecture.
A detailed description of the health check protocol can be in the link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-health/tree/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/protocol-wireformat.adoc[companion document]

### Java API

The main API to describe health check results (responses) is the `HealthCheck` interface:

```
@FunctionalInterface
public interface HealthCheck {

    Response call();
}
```

Applications are expected to provide health check procedures (implementation of a `HealthCheck`), which will be used by the
the framework, platform or runtime hosting the application to verify the healthiness of the computing node .


### CDI Integration

A possible integration with CDI:

```
@ApplicationScoped()
public class CheckDiskpace implements HealthCheck {

    public Response call() {
        [...]
    }
}
```

### Constructing health `Response`s

Application level code is expected to use one of static methods on `Response` to retrieve a builder used to construct a Response:

```
public class SuccessfulCheck implements HealthCheck {
    @Override
    public Response call() {
        return Response.named("successful-check").up();
    }
}
```
