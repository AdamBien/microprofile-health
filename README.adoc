# Service Healthchecks

## Motivation

Health checks are used to probe the state of a computing node from another other machine (i.e. kubernetes service controller) with the primary target being cloud infrastructure environments where automated processes maintain the state of computing nodes.

In this scenario _health checks are used to determine if a computing node needs to be discarded (terminated, shutdown)_ and eventually replaced by another (healthy) instance.

It’s not intended (although could be used) as a monitoring solution for human operators.

## Proposed solution

The proposed solution breaks down into two parts:

- A health checks protocol and wireformat
- A Java API to implement health check procedures

## Detailed design

### Protocol

This project defines a protocol (wireformat, semantics and possible forms of interactions) between system components that need to determine the “liveliness” of computing nodes in a bigger architecture.
A detailed description of the health check protocol can be found in the link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-health/tree/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/protocol-wireformat.adoc[companion document]

### Java API

The main API to provide health check procedures on the application level is the `HealthCheck` interface:

```
@FunctionalInterface
public interface HealthCheck {

    Response call();
}
```

Applications are expected to provide health check procedures (implementation of a `HealthCheck`), which will be used by the
the framework or runtime hosting the application to verify the healthiness of the computing node.

The runtime will `call()` the `HealthCheck` which in turn creates a `Response` that signals the health status to a consuming end:

```
public abstract class Response {
   
    public enum State { UP, DOWN }

    public abstract String getName();

    public abstract State getState();

    public abstract Optional<Map<String, Object>> getAttributes();
    
    [...]
}
```
### Constructing health `Response`s

Application level code is expected to use one of static methods on `Response` to retrieve a `ResponseBuilder` used to construct a `Response`, i.e. :

```
public class SuccessfulCheck implements HealthCheck {
    @Override
    public Response call() {
        return Response.named("successful-check").up();
    }
}
```

### Integration with CDI

Within CDI contexts, beans that implement `HealthCheck` are discovered automatically and and invoked by the framework or runtime when the outermost protocol entry point (i.e. `http:/HOST:PORT/health`) receives an inbound request.

```
@ApplicationScoped
public class CheckDiskpace implements HealthCheck {

    public Response call() {
        [...]
    }
}
```

# SPI Usage

Implementors of the API are expected to supply implementations of `Response` and `ResponseBuilder` by providing a `SPIFactory` for their runtime. The `SPIFactory` is used internally to create a `ResponseBuilder` which is used to construct a `Response`. This pattern allows implementors to extend a `Response` and adapt it to their implementation needs. Common implementation details that fall into this category are invocation and security contexts required to map `Response` to the outermost invocation protocol.
